This script adds a simple and immersive vehicle lock system that allows players to lock and unlock their vehicles using a keybind or command.

Players can toggle their vehicle lock within a configurable range and receive clear notifications for each action.
An optional key sharing system allows vehicle owners to share or revoke keys with nearby players, giving them access to lock and unlock the same vehicle.
